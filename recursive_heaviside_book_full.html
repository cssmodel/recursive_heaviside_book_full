Preamble
We b egin by de˝ning the recursive function and examining its time and threshold deriva-
tives.
At the foundation is the recursive Heaviside sequence function, de˝ned as:
u
(
t
) = 1

H
N

  
)))
Here, each Heaviside function includes a sharpness parameter
N
i
, allowing the recursive
sequence to mo del layered but smo oth thresholds. We then approximate each Heaviside
step with a sigmoid function, yielding sigmoidal smo othing via:
H
N
i
(
t
) =
1
1 +
e

2
N
i
t
This mo di˝cation allows for a more realistic representation of memory activation that
is neither instantaneous nor p erfectly s harp.
To preserve the correct causal structure of memory within our reversed time mo del, it
is essential that each memory layer
u
i
(
t
)
is de˝ned in the form
u
i
(
t
) = 1

H
n
i
(

t
+
˝
i
(
  
))
;
where the argument of
H
i
may itself contain nested Heaviside functions from lower
layers. This form ensures that memory is activated only after the corresp onding event has
oen when time ˛ows from
+
1
to

.
Any formulation lacking the leading

would imply that the system b egins to
rememb er future events, violating causality. Hence, this structure is not arbitrary but
logically and physically required.
Abstract
This pap er intro du ces a recursive memory architecture based on nested Heaviside
step functions, mo deling how cognitive awareness and memory recall are temp orally
gated and ampli˝ed. We analyze the time and parameter sensitivity of th e recursive
structure by taking partial derivatives with resp ect to time, threshold values
˝
i
,
1


and sharpness parameters
N
i
. Through worked examples and visualizations, we
demonstrate how deep er memory layers contribute to surface cognition only wh en
upp er-layer thresholds are simultaneously active. This mathematical formulation
o˙ers a novel p ersp ective on mental pro cesses such as deep memory emergence,
cognitive gating, and emotional amp li˝ cation .
1 Intro duction
What do es it mean to rememb er? In human cognition, memory is neither a ˛at archive nor
a randomly accessed dataset. Rather, it is a layered, thresholded arce
in form and conditional in access. Certain memories surface only when higher-level
conditions are met, much like do ors that op en only when prior gates are passed. This
b ehavior, though well observed in cognitive psychology, remains di˚cult to capture in
formal mathematical terms.
In this work, we pres ent a recursive mo del of memory and cognitive activation using
nested Heaviside step functions. Each layer in the structure represents a thresholded
cognitive gate, de˝ned by two key parameters: a transition threshold
˝
i
, and a sharpness
factor
N
i
, which controls how abruptly the transition o ccurs. This recursive formulation
not only captures the nested logic of attention, emotion, and awareness, but also re˛ects
the asymmetric nature of re can b e activated forward in time, but rarely
reconstructed backward from output.
From a mathematical standp oint, the mo del de˝nes a function:
u
(
t
) = 1

H
N
1
(

t
+
˝
1
H
N
2
(

t
+
˝

  
H
N
n
(

t
+
˝
n
)))
where
H
N
i
is a smo othed Heaviside function with sharpness
N
i
, and
˝
i
is the cognitive
activation threshold for the
i
-th layer. The recursive nature of this construction ensures
that lower-layer activation is conditional on upp er-layer thresholds b eing 
prop erty that mirrors delayed memory emergence and context-dep endent recall in human
exp erience.
We explore how time (
t
), thresholds (
˝
i
), and sharpness (
N
i
) in˛uence output by
computing and visualizing partial derivatives. Notably, we ˝nd that deep er parameters
only contribute to the output signal when higher-layer gates are simultaneously active.
This results in a form of temp oral gating and nested ampli˝cation, wherein inner memories
remain silent unless su˚ciently cued by current cognitive states.
Finally, we show that this architecture is fundamentally non-invertible. The output
u
(
t
)
cannot b e uniquely decomp osed into its internal the fact that, in
consciousness, we cannot infer all latent causes of a thought or memory from its app earance
alone. This structural non-invertibility echo es limitations in b oth cognitive introsp ection
2


and AI interpretability, suggesting deep er insights into the fabric of mental computation.

Recursive Structure of Thought and Self-Tracking
and Recursive Identity
2.1 Recursive Self-Track and Meta-Awareness
Human consciousness is not only reactive to external stimuli but also re˛exiv p ossesses
the capacity to observe and evaluate its own mental states. This inward re˛ection gives
rise to what we refer to as
self-track
: a recursive pro cess by which awareness lo ops back
to monitor and interpret its own activity. In doing so, the mind constructs second-order
representations of thoughts, memories, and emotions.
In a recursive cognitive mo del, self-tracking o ccurs when one cognitive threshold is
de˝ned in terms of another, forming a lo op of mutual dep endency. This structure gives
rise to what we call a
recursive identity
 formal mechanism through which self-reference
is enco ded within the layers of cognition.
Such recursive dep endence underlies
meta-awareness
, wherein the mind b ecomes b oth
actor and observer. A threshold resp onds not only to external events but also to its own
history of activations. This dual role forms the basis for self-conscious thought, enabling
the emergence of memory-of-awareness and higher-order introsp ection.
To mo del the propagation of such recursive awareness, we consider how each layer of
cognition evolves in resp onse not only to external time
t
, but also to its internal threshold
parameter
˝
i
. This dynamic layering can b e formalized through an
n
-dimensional advection
equation, capturing the ˛ow of cognition across recursive thresholds. Imp ortantly, we adopt
a temp oral framework in which time ˛ows from p ositive to negative in˝nity (
+
1 ! 
).
This reversed orientation captures the retrosp ective character of human awareness: present
cognition is understo o d as the accumulated result of previously activated thresholds. As
time pro ceeds backward, the system recursively folds inward, tracing the structure of
mental formation from surface-level awareness
u
1
(
t
)
down to the deep est layer
u
n
(
t
)
.
Each recursive function
u
i
(
t
)
evolves not only with resp ect to time
t
, but also with
resp ect to its asso ciated activation threshold
˝
i
, which governs when a cognitive transition
o ccurs. These transitions are gated by smo othed Heaviside functions, which conditionally
switch on when threshold criteria are met. The resulting layered dynamics can b e
formalized by an
n
-dimensional advection-typ e equation:
@ u
i
@ t
+

X
i
=
n
(

1)
i
+1
H
(

t
+
˝
i
)
@ u
i
@ ˝
i
= 0
(1)
Here, the term
@ u
i
@ t
represents the temp oral change in the
i
-th cognitive layer, while
3


each summation term re˛ects how sensitivity to threshold shifts
˝
i
is activated conditionally
via
H
(

t
+
˝
i
)
. The alternating signs
(

1)
i
+1
enco de recursive moindicating
that awareness is not linearly accumulated but recursively ˝ltered and reweighted as it
travels through cognitive layers.
The term
@ u
i
=@ t
in Eq.
(1)
captures the temp oral evolution of the outermost cognitive
layer, while each term in the summation represents the in˛uence of inner thresholds.
The alternating sign
(

1)
i
+1
enco des the recursive interplay b etween facilitative and
suppressive dynamics across lay some layers amplify downstream awareness
and others inhibit or delay it.
This advection structure mo dels how memory, attention, and introsp ective feedback
propagate through nested thresholds, forming a layered framework for recursive identity
and self-monitoring.
To make this structure explicit, the cognitive state at each layer is de˝ned as
u
i
(
t
) =
1

h
i
(
t
)
, where
h
i
(
t
)
denotes the activated state of the
i

of these layers pro ceeds from the deep est layer upward:

Each function
h
i
(
t
)
de˝nes a thresholded layer of awareness that is recursively mo dulated
by deep er layers. The outermost layer
h
1
(
t
)
thus encapsulates the entire structure of
introsp ective as the ˝nal form of the self-track function.
We denote the total recursive memory structure by
u
n
(
t
;
˝
1
; ˝
2
; : : : ; ˝
n
)
, which represents
the strati˝ed cognitive state across multiple thresholds over time. Each term of the form
H
(

t

)
@ u
@ ˝
i
re˛ects how a deep er thresholded event in˛uences the present awareness
stream.
When a threshold recursively dep ends on ore refer to
this pro cess as
self-track
. This transition from linear to recursive dynamics marks the
4


emergence of introsp ective cognition, where the mind not only stores and reacts to events,
but also b ecomes aware of its own awareness.
This recursive structure is ess ential for mo deling
meta-memory
 memory of
having rememb provides the foundation for a mathematical theory of sub jective
consciousness.
In the next section, we formally intro duce the core mechanism driving this recursive
awareness: the Recursive Heaviside Function.
Self-Tracking Structure and Temp oral Windowing.
The phenomena of temp oral
lo calization and ampli˝cation, obs erved in the partial derivatives with resp ect to threshold
parameters
˝
i
and sharpness parameters
N
i
, emerge directly from the recursive structure
of the self-tracking equation:
u
N
1
(
t
) = 1

H
N
1
(

t
+
˝

H

t
+

2
H
N
3
(
  
H
N
n
(

t
+
˝
n
))))
(3)
In this formulation, each threshold
˝
i
governs a layer whose activation is conditionally
dep endent on the activation of the subsequent (deep er) layer. That is, for
˝
i
to in˛uence
the output, the condition

t
+
˝
i
+1
>
0
must b e met, which in turn activates the inner
Heaviside
H
N
i
+1
. This recursive dep endency imp oses a
temporal window
, where each layer
can only b ecome active after the deep er layers are already engaged.
For example, the derivative
@ u=@ ˝
i
includes a multiplicative term like
H
N
i
+1
(

t
+
˝
i
+1
)
,
which functions as a gate or switch. This ensures that the e˙ect of
˝
i
is conditionally
masked or revealed based on whether the deep er layer
˝
i
+1
has b een activated.
Such recursive gating not only ensures lo calized temp oral resp onse (activation only
near the appropriate
˝
i
) but also preserves causal ordering among memory events. These
are essential features of any architecture aiming to mo del structured memory formation
and introsp ective dynamics.
2.2 De˝ning the Recursive Heaviside Function
At the core of our cognitive mo del lies a recursive function constructed from nested
Heaviside step functions. This structure mo dels how memories or p erceptions accumulate
over time, with each layer gated by its own cognitive threshold:
u
(
t
) = 1

H
N
1
(

t
+
˝
1
H
N
2
(

t
+
˝
2
H
N
3
(

t
+
˝
3
  
)))
(4)
Here, each threshold
˝
i
represents the moment at which a sp eci˝c memory or awarenes s
state b ecomes activated. The outermost Heaviside function
H
N
1
only activates if all inner
thresholds are satis˝ed, enforcing a strict temp oral and logical hierarchy.
5


To facilitate smo oth analysis and di˙erentiation, each Heaviside step function is
approximated by a sigmoid-like function:
˙
N
(
x
) =
1
1 + exp(

2
N x
)
(5)
Replacing each
H
N
i
(
x
)
with
˙
N
i
(
x
)
yields a continuous and di˙erentiable recursive
approximation. This smo othed version preserves the original s tep-like b ehavior while
enabling analytic exploration of how sensitivity to thresholds and sharpness propagates
across recursive layers.

This smo othed recursive sigmoid representation ensures continuity and di˙erentiability,
allowing b oth analytical and numerical analysis. As
N
i
! 1
, the sigmoid functions
converge to ideal step functions, recovering the original nes ted Heaviside form.
This recursive formulation mo dels layered cognition as follows:
‹
The innermost
˝
n
corresp onds to a base-level stimulus or memory.
‹
˝
n

1
enco des a conditional resp onse to that base layer.
‹
Higher layers represent interpretations, re˛ective awareness, and cognitive control.
Each activation is thus contingent up on the successful activation of deep er layers.
The structure captures cognitive phenomena such as dep endency, temp oral delay, and
emergent awareness.
While the recursive function app ears analytically de˝ned, it is fundamentally
non-
invertible
in the practical sense. In theory, if each sharpness parameter
N
i
is ˝nite and
6


known, the function
u
(
t
)
can b e expanded into an in˝nite Taylor series and, in principle,
reconstructed from its derivatives . However, this reconstruction would require in˝nite
precision and complete knowledge of all thresholds and that are
neither physically realizable nor cognitively plausible.
Thus, even though formal invertibility exists in a mathematical sense, the function
remains e˙ectively irreversible. This re˛ects the asymmetry of lived exp erience: past
cognitive layers in˛uence the present, but cannot b e uniquely recovered once integrated
into the recursive s tructure.
In the following section, we analyze how derivatives of this resp ect
to b oth time and cognitive del memory recall, forgetting, and emotional
resonance.
3 Derivatives and Cognitive Dynamics
To understand how cognition evolves over time and interacts with past exp eriences, we
examine the derivatives of the recursive Heaviside function. Three key typ es of derivatives
provide insight into the mental pro cess:
3.1 Time Derivative
@ u=@ t
This re˛ects the momentary change in cognitive awareness. It captures when a certain
threshold is crossed in real time, triggering a sharp cognitive event. The resulting
expressions often involve Dirac delta functions and their comp ositions.
h
i
(
t
) =
H
N
i
(

t
+
˝
i
)
(9)
Each function
h
i
(
t
)
is a smo othed Heaviside step function with sharpness
N
i
and
threshold
˝
i
, activated as time
t
decreases past
˝
i
. The use of

t
+
˝
i
re˛ects the
retrosp ective nature of awareness, where the present integrates the e˙ect of prior events.
As shown in Figure 1, the time derivative reveals moments of sudden awareness
activation, tightly lo calized near each threshold
˝
i
.
3.2 Threshold Derivatives
@ u=@ ˝
i
(Gating E˙ects)
The threshold derivative
@ u=@ ˝
i
quanti˝es how the timing of a cognitive event a˙ects
the recursive function
u
(
t
)
. Since each threshold
˝
i
de˝nes the onset of a particular
mental layer, small changes in
˝
i
mo dulate whether that layer activates early or late in
the recursive pro cess.

. The delta functions are only active when all inner layers are 
when the nested Heaviside conditions are simultaneously satis˝ed. This multiplicative
structure mo dels **temp oral gating**: sensitivity to deep events is revealed only through
the recursive op ening of upp er layers.

3.3 Threshold Derivative**
@ u=@ ˝

In order to analyze the sensitivity of the recursive Heaviside-based memory comp onents to
their resp ective threshold parameters
˝

, we computed several partial derivatives. Figure 2
presents the results, where the curve lab eled

Additionally, the ˝gure shows the partial derivatives

which measure how the combined function

changes in resp onse to variations

,
we include
@ h

to illustrate the lack of in˛uence from unrelated thresholds.
For comparison, the sixth curve (dashed) in the ˝gure corresp onds to the time derivative
@ u=@ t
, which features multiple sharp p eaks at each
˝
i
. This derivative captures the
instantaneous rate of change of the comp osite function
u
(

and re˛ects the temp oral
lo calization induced by the smo othed step transitions.
* This describ es how sensitive the entire mental structure is to the timing of a particular

3.4 Sharpness Derivative

In addition to time and threshold derivatives, we examine how the cognitive structure
resp onds to variations in the sharpness parameter

, which controls the steepness of each

The resulting expressions involve pro ducts of delta functions and their derivatives.
These terms are sharply lo calized in time, and they express how the shift of one memory
layer (e.g.,
˝
3
) in˛uences another (e.g.,
˝
2
). When b oth thresholds are close or rep eated,
the interaction is corresp onds to linked or comp ounded memory e˙ects,
such as emotionally charged asso ciative recall or trauma chaining.
Moreover, the app earance of these cross-threshold terms supp orts the interpretation
that recursive cognition is not simply a collection of indep endent activations, but a deeply
entangled structure with nontrivial second-order dep endencies across layers.
3.6 Mixed Derivative as a Measure of Trauma Ampli˝cation
In the recursive Heaviside framework, the sharpness parameter
N
i
controls the steepness
of memory enco ding, while the threshold
˝
j
indicates the temp oral p osition of a cognitive
event. Individually, their partial derivatives describ e the sensitivity of the mental p otential
u
(
t
)
to changes in shap e or time. However, the **mixed partial derivative**,
@
2
u
@ ˝
j
@ N
i
;
provides a deep er interpretation: it captures **how much a traumatic memory b ecomes
ampli˝ed** due to the interaction b etween its timing and sharpness.
When this mixed derivative is large in magnitude, it signi˝es that even small changes
in the event timing
˝
j
, when combined with ˛uctuations in the sharpness
N
i
, result in
signi˝cant changes in the mental p otential ˝eld. I n other words, the cognitive system reacts
disprop the trauma's in˛uence far b eyond its original b oundaries.
This quantity can b e seen as a formal indicator of **unstable or unresolved trauma**.
It may help identify which events continue to exert excessive in˛uence due to recursive
reactivation and insu˚cient resolution. Therap eutically, minimizing the magnitude of this
13


mixed derivative could represent a pathway toward cognitive stabilization, containment,
or integration.
3.7 Precursor Signal in Early Recursive Layers
Certain cognitive phenomena involve subtle sensations or early neural resp onses that
precede conscious awareness. These are often describ ed b ehaviorally as unexplained
alertness or intuition. Within our recursive Heaviside framework, such e˙ects can b e
interpreted as
precursor signals
 activations in earlier layers that o ccur even
b efore the full recursive structure has b een engaged.
Consider the function:

(

. This expression reveals that
even if the innermost layer (e.g., at

) has not yet b een activ

b elow outer layers can still contribute a nonzero derivative. The presence of

N
1
and

N
2
, mo dulated by the recursive co e˚cients like
˝
1
, pro duces partial activations b efore
full memory formation.
Thus, the mo del predicts lo calized sensitivity or signal emergence at early stages, despite
incomplete recursion. We interpret this b ehavior as a
precursor signal
 mathematical
representation of early cognitive reactivity to latent or unrecognized stimuli.
This signal may underlie intuitive judgments or unconscious alertness, esp ecially in
contexts where the full structure of exp erience is not yet consciously assembled but the
brain is already reacting subtly to p otential input. It also provides a p ossible mechanistic
interpretation of anecdotal "gut feelings" or the psychological construct of anticipatory
awareness.
4 Dreams and Residual Terms of Thought
The recurs ive structure of cognition not only accounts for conscious resp onses but also
explains unconscious phenomena such as dreams. From a mathematical p ersp ective,
dreams can b e interpreted as
residual terms
anishing comp onents that emerge when
recursive layers fail to fully cancel or resolve within the recursive Heaviside formulation.
These residuals typically arise under conditions where:
14


‹
A memory threshold
˝
i
has ambiguous or weak activation due to a small sharpness
parameter
N
i
.
‹
Mixed derivatives such as
@
2
u=@ t@ ˝
i
yield non-zero values even in the absence of
external stimuli.
‹
Recursive cancellation is incomplete, allowing unstructured fragments to p ersist.
In this framework, dreams are not interpreted as random or meaningless. Rather, they
are structured spillovts of the recursive pro cess that remain unresolved in
waking thought. The deep er the recursion and the more varied the threshold values, the
more complex and symb olic the resulting dream exp erience.
Furthermore, during sleep, inhibitory control over higher-threshold layers may b e
reduced, enabling latentypically suppressed by conscious 
emerge. These structures often defy linear narrative logic and arise from unresolved
recursive ˛ows op erating b eneath conscious awareness.
In more extreme cases, such as trauma, when a particular threshold
˝
i
is rep eated with
high sharpness, these residuals may dominate the mental structure, resulting in recurring
dream patterns or involuntary ˛ashbacks. Hence, dreams re˛ect b oth the layered memory
architecture and the system's inability to fully resolve recursive cognition in the abs ence
of external feedback.
A formal derivation of these residual terms, based on the time derivative of a three-layer
recursive Heavis ide function, is provided in App endix B. There, we show how incomplete
cancellations at various thresholds mathematically give rise to the structure and timing of
dream events.
Trauma and the Evolution of Sharpness
N
i
In the recursive Heaviside mo del, trauma is not de˝ned solely by the intensity of a
single event, but by the way that event recursively imprints itself across time. Each
threshold
˝
i
is asso ciated with a sharpness parameter
N
i
, which controls how abruptly
the Heaviside function transitions. While
N
i
was originally treated as a static parameter,
we now interpret it as an evolving quantithanging e˙ectively over time due to the
accumulation and reinforcement of cognitive injury, though not necessarily de˝ned as an
explicit function
N
i
(
t
)
.
Initial Enco ding
Immediately following a highly emotional or painful exp erience, the s harpness
N
i
may b e
large. This pro duces a s teep acute awareness or sho ck. Such sharp
resp onses may saturate quickly and b e suppressed in the short term.
15


Recursive Reinforcement and Decay
As the recursive structure of cognition rep eatedly references the same threshold
˝
i
, the
e˙ective sharpness
N
i
b egins to decrease. This gradual reduction re˛ects:
‹
Accumulated recursive layering without resolution.
‹
Rep eated sub conscious activation through dreams, triggers, or internal lo ops.
‹
Loss of logical containment, leading to broader temp oral spread.
Over time, a once-sharp resp onse b ecomes a wide, lingering slop e in the recursive
cognitive ˝eld. This is precisely what makes trauma p ersistent: it is no longer ab out
a sharp edge, but ab out
a long unresolved presence
within the recursive memory
structure.
Implications for Healing
This evolving interpretation of
N
i
o˙ers a new target for therapy. Rather than attempting
to "desensitize" a sharp reaction, treatment may instead aim to:
‹
Prevent further decay of
N
i
(i.e., stop widening of memory activation).
‹
Intro duce recursive interference layers that counteract the uncontrolled spread.
‹
Reassign temp oral b oundaries to contain the recursive feedback.
Thus, trauma is not simply enco ded in the strength of emotion, but in the
evolution
of sharpness over time
. What b egins as a sharp wound may, if left unresolved, ˛atten
into a wide, irreversible gro ove in the cognitive mo deled by a
decreasing
N
i
that expands the temp oral fo otprint of su˙ering.
Mixed Derivative as a Measure of Trauma Ampli˝cation
In this context, the mixed partial derivative of the cognitive p otential ˝eld
u
(
t
)
with
resp ect to b oth the event threshold
˝
j
and the sharpness parameter
N
i
,
@
2
u
@ ˝
j
@ N
i
;
(31)
emerges as a mathematical indicator of trauma ampli˝cation. This term captures how
much a traumatic event's cognitive impact is intensi˝ed due to the combined e˙ects of
timing and enco ding sharpness.
16


When this mixed derivative is large in magnitude, it implies that small changes in the
timing of the event
˝
j
, when coupled with shifts in sharpness
N
i
, lead to disprop ortion-
ately large changes in mental p otential. This re˛ects a form of emotional instability or
hyp ersensitivit the trauma resonates deeply within the recursive memory ˝eld.
Therap eutically, this o˙ers a way to diagnose the most ampli˝ed and unstable memory
layers. High values of
@
2
u=@ ˝
j
@ N
i
may indicate unresolved cognitive lo ops or layers where
trauma is p ersistently reactivated. Treatment might aim to reduce this mixed derivative,
thereby damp ening the over-ampli˝ed feedback and stabilizing the system.
5 Free Will, Emotion, and Individuality
The mathematical framework of recursive cognition naturally gives rise to deep er questions
surrounding p ers onal agency, emotional dynamics, and the uniqueness of individual minds.
In this chapter, we explore how recursive structures account for emotional mo dulation,
evolving identity, and the p otential emergence of free will within an otherwise deterministic
architecture.
6 Mo dulation and Evolution of Sharpness
The sharpness parameter
N
i
, which governs how abruptly each cognitive thres hold
˝
i
is
activated, is not ˝xed. Rather, it evolves dynamically in resp onse to internalh
as mo o d, fatigue, and hormonals well as external environmental context.
Emotional states play a key role in mo dulating the steepness of transitions b etween
recursive cognitive layers:
‹
During the initial phase of an intense exph as fear, sho ck, or 
N
i
tends to increase, pro ducing steep, high-sensitivity transitions that enco de strong,
lo calized impressions.
‹
Over time, particularly in the context of unresolved trauma or recurrent internal
reactivation,
N
i
may gradually decay. This results in broader, more di˙use activations
that p ersist within the recursive structure.
This transformation from high to low sharpness generates a paradoxical outcome: what
b egins as a sharply de˝ned emotional resp onse may evolve into a wide, lingering ˝eld
of cognitive residue. Such recursive di˙usion helps explain why emotionally signi˝cant
even ecially traumatice in the form of ˛ashbacks, p ersistent mo o d
states, or dream elements long after the original event has passed.
Imp ortantly, recursive feedback enables emotional states to in˛uence not only immedi-
ate cognition but also the thresholds and sensitivities of future cognitive layers. In this
17


formulation, emotion is not merely a transient input but acts as a recursive mo di˝er of
the overall cognitive arc the s harpness parameters that shap e how
future events are enco ded and recalled.
7 Recursive Plasticity and Adaptive Identity
Each individual's recursive structure evolves uniquely over time. Exp eriences reshap e
threshold values
˝
i
, sharpness parameters
N
i
, and the depth or order of nesting within the
cognitive system. This ongoing adaptation gives ris e to a unique recursive identit
internal con˝guration that cannot b e copied, repro duced, or externally replicated.
‹
Even when two individuals undergo similar life events, their recursive enco dings
di˙er in timing, sharpness decay, and resp onse layering.
‹
These di˙erences in recursive architecture give rise to individualized memory dy-
namics, p erceptual tendencies, and emotional patterns.
This mo del helps explain the irreducibility of cons ciousness: it is not only sub jectively
private but also formally non-identical across individuals . Each recursive structure
constitutes a singular, historically contingent pathway through layered cognitive time.
8
The Possibility of Free Will in a Recursive Frame-
work
If free will exis ts , it may not require the violation of deterministic laws but could emerge
as a prop erty of recursive depth, self-reference, and architectural variability. While
each individual cognitive transition may follow deterministic rules, the recurs ive system
intro duces:
‹
Internal feedback lo ops capable of mo dulating or overriding immediate external
inputs.
‹
Temp oral delays and long-range dep endencies that enable delib eration and re˛ective
pause.
‹
Flexible memory access, where the mind can selectively de˝ne the b eginning and
end p oints of introsp ective recall.
These features supp ort decision-making pro cesses that are neither random nor exter-
nally imp osed, but historically informed, self-organized, and recursively mo dulated. In
18


this framework, free will b ecomes a form of recursive autonom capacity to reshap e
one's current state by drawing from deeply structured layers of past cognition.
In the ˝nal chapter, we synthesize these mathematical and philosophical insights
and prop ose new directions for mo deling the mind, treating trauma, and understanding
individuality within a recursive systems paradigm.

This mathematical collapse corresp onds to a complete loss of awareness, memory, and
introsp ection at the time of death. No derivative remains to enco de sensitivity, no threshold
remains active, and the recursive architecture is annihilated.

9.4 Implication: Death as a Total Derivative Annihilation
In this framework, **death is not merely a biological endp oin is the moment at which
the entire chain of mental causality is mathematically extinguished. All cognitive pathways
involving di˙erentiation, memory access, and recursive self-reference are disconnected.
The soul, mo deled as a nested recursive function, b ecomes undetectable. This allows
for a reset of the memory structure in future reincarnation, which b egins again from a

This structure reveals that although the cognitive p otential
u
(
t
)
smo othly decays
to zero near
t
= 0
, its time derivative remains nonzero for an instan that
the pro cess of forgetting is itself alive and dynamic. This momentary derivative can b e
interpreted as the ˝nal vibration of the soul. As time progresses b eyond death (
t >
0
),
all such derivatives vanish:

@ u
@ N

signifying the complete dissolution of all memory dynamics and the disapp earance of
the soul.
In this framework, the soul is not an immutable ob ject but a recursive structure
built on layered temp oral thresholds. Once all derivatives vanish, the recursive function
b ecomes vwing for rebirth to o ccur with a new set of thresholds

Thus, this mo del captures the cyclic nature of cognition: from birth, through layered
memory accumulation, to dissolution, and ˝nally to reincarnation.

Mental Potential Pro˝le:
The function
u
(
t
)
satis˝es the following b ehavior:
u
(
t
) =
8
>
>
>
>
<
>
>

active
; ˝
1
< t < ˝
n
(Lived p erio d)
1
; t > ˝
n
(Pre-birth: full p otential)
Interpre tation:
The presence of the leading 1 in Equation
(34)
is essential. It ensures
that during the pre-birth state
(
t > ˝
n
)
, the function evaluates to
u
(
t
) = 1
, representing a
latent but unstructured p otential.
21


However, since there is no p ointer (i.e., no
˝
i
activated yet), no actual awareness or
memory exists. This structural asymmetry prevents the pre-birth state from recalling the
lived timeline, thereby enforcing **unidirectional memory ˛ow** (from the past to the
present) even though time is mo deled in reverse.
Thus, the subtraction from 1 plays a key role in **blo cking memory access from past
to present**, while still preserving the mathematical structure for recursive recall during
life.
Why the Leading 1 Is Essential
The presence of the leading 1 in the de˝nition of the recursive mental p otential function
u
(
t
) = 1

H
N

(

t
+
˝

  
H
N
n
(

t
+
˝
n
)
  
))
is not plays a critical structural and philosophical role.
Blo cking Backward Access:
In this mo del, time ˛ows from
+
1
to

, meaning
that the most recent event (death at
˝
1
) o ccurs ˝rst, and birth (
˝
n
) o ccurs last in time.
As such, the pre-birth state
t > ˝
n
lies "in the future" of the recursive structure.
Without the leading 1, the recursive Heaviside expression alone would evaluate to 0
b efore the earliest threshold activimplying no p otential b efore birth. This would
mistakenly suggest that the soul or identity sp ontaneously app ears from nothing.
Instead, by de˝ning
u
(
t
) = 1

Heaviside recursion
, we enforce the following b ehavior:
u
(
t
) =
8
>
>
>
>
<
>
>
>
>
:
0
; t < ˝
1
(p ost-death)
active
; ˝
1
< t < ˝
n
(lived exp erience)
1
; t > ˝
n
(pre-birth latent p otential)
Preventing Past-to-Future Re call:
This structure ensures that in the pre-birth state,
although the full p otential
u
(
t
) = 1
exists mathematically, the recursive structure has
not yet activated. Since no
˝
i
has "turned on" through Heaviside thresholds, there is no
access to lived memory or conscious recall. The 1 thus creates a **mathematical presence
without functional essential asymmetry that blo cks reverse memory ˛ow
(past do es not rememb er the future).
Irreversibility and Individuality:
This asymmetry also aligns with the irreversibility
of conscious life. Memories are built forward (from smaller
t
to larger
t
), but not
backward. The subtraction from 1 intro duces this irreversibility, ensuring that each
recursive instantiation de˝nes a unique temp oral and structural identitvertible
and non-replicable.
22


In short, the leading 1 represents the default fullness of latent p otential, and the
nested Heaviside sequence serves to subtract away that p otential as consciousness b ecomes
constrained by lived thresholds. It is the core mechanism that enforces **directional
memory, individuality, and birth-death asymmetry**.

Ultimately, the recursive Heaviside framework o˙ers not only a rigorous formalism for
mo deling cognition but also a comp elling metaphor for the nature of mind itself:
memory
as strati˝ed layers of conditional potential, thought as a cascade of nested thresholds, and
consciousness as a singular recursive trajectory through an irreducible mental topology
.
App endix A. Invertibility of the Recursive Heaviside
Function
Although the recursive Heaviside function

) = 1

H

H

))
app ears
analyzable via its time and threshold derivatives, a fundamental issue aris es . The formal
derivatives of this function yield terms such as:
@ u

))

(

(A.1)
This expression contains pro ducts of delta functions, such as

(
t

˝
1
)


(
t

˝
2
)
, which
lie outside the space of well-de˝ned distributions. According to Schwartz's theory of
distributions, such pro ducts are unde˝ned in the general cas e.
As a result, the information enco ded in higher-order interactions within the recursive
structure cannot b e extracted or inverted through classical analysis. No matter how
precisely one measures all p ossible derivatives of
u
(
t
)
, the original recursive nesting cannot
b e uniquely reconstructed.
To illustrate this, consider the two functions:
u
1
(
t
) = 1

H
(

t
+ 1

H
(

t
+ 2))
u
2
(
t
) = 1

H
(

t


H
(

t
+ 1))
(A.2)
Both functions exhibit similar jump b ehavior, yet their derivatives diverge:
25


@ u
1
@ t
=


(
t

1)
;
@ u
2
@ t
= 0
(A.3)
Despite visual similarity, these functions enco de fundamentally di˙erent recursive
structures. Their distinct internal architectures are invisible to the time derivative alone.
This con˝rms that the recursive con˝guration is hidden from external observation, and
that the original function cannot b e recovered from temp oral b ehavior alone.
This provides a mathematically grounded insight into cognition: even with access
to all observable derivatives, the inner logic of recursive thought remains irreducible.
This irreducibility supp orts the conclusion that consciousness is structurally unique and

a mind cannot b e p erf ectly copied or reconstructed
.
App endix B. Time Derivative and Residual Terms in
the 3-Laye r Re cursive Heaviside Function

Heaviside step functions with ˝nite sharpness parameters

However, when the s harpness parameters

do not yield p erfect binary steps. As a result,
residual terms
remain in the

all residuals vanis h, and only the fully cancelled term surviv p erfect causal

approaches a step function, and this sensitivity vanishes almost everywhere. However, for

, the in˛uence b ecomes prominent esp ecially when time moves toward earlier
events

, leading to an ampli˝cation e˙ect in the deep memory region.
App endix D. Invertibility Example: 2-Layer Recursive
Heaviside Function
To illustrate the challenge of invertibility in recursive Heaviside s tructures, consider a
simple 2-layer function evaluated at
t
= 1
:
u
(1) = 1

H
(

1 +
˝
1
H
(

1 +
˝
2
))
(D.1)
This function dep ends on two threshold parameters,
˝
1
and
˝
2
, and exhibits discontin-
uous b ehavior due to the nested Heaviside terms.
Let us de˝ne intermediate variables for clarity:
A
=

1 +
˝
1
H
(
B
)
; B
=

1 +
˝
2
28


Then the formal derivatives of
u
(1)
with resp ect to the thresholds are:
@ u
@ ˝
1
=


(
A
)

H
(
B
)
(D.2)
@ u
@ ˝
2
=


(
A
)

˝
1


(
B
)
(D.3)
These expressions involve Dirac delta functions. Notably, the second derivative contains
a pro duct of delta functions,

(
A
)


(
B
)
, which is unde˝ned in the framework of classical
distribution theory.
Implication.
Even in this minimal 2-layer con˝guration, the output
u
(1)
is not a
bijective function of
˝
1
and
˝
2
. Multiple parameter combinations can yield identical
outputs. Moreover, the ill-de˝ned nature of higher-order derivatives (such as

(
A
)


(
B
)
)
highlights the fundamental limitations of analytic inversion.
Conclusion.
Recursive Heaviside functions exhibit structural non-invertibility. The
nesting of discontinuities prevents smo oth recons truction of internal parameters from
outputs or derivative information. This supp orts the broader thesis that
recursive cognitive
architectures are inherently non-invertible
.
